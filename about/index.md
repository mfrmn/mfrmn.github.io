## Bio

Michael Freeman is a fourth year PhD Candidate at the University of Cambridge Judge Business School. His research is broadly in the area of Operations Management, with a focus on Healthcare and Service Operations. Working closely with hospital partners, Michael investigates how healthcare organizations can improve service delivery and increase productivity. In his previous and ongoing research he has examined the impact of factors such as congestion, staff behavior, and organizational structure on system performance and service outcomes such as quality and costs. As an expert in econometric methods, he regularly adopts a data-driven approach in order to help organizations to better manage and make better informed strategic decisions.

Michael holds an MPhil degree in Management Science and Operations from the University of Cambridge and a BA and Masters in Mathematics, Operations Research, Statistics and Economics from Warwick University. His PhD research at Cambridge is fully funded by an Economic and Social Research Council DTC scholarship, and he has been awarded further research grants by the University of Cambridge Judge Business School, the Learning Innovation Fund, and Robinson College. He is supervised internally by [Prof. Stefan Scholtes](http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/faculty-a-z/stefan-scholtes/) and externally by [Dr. Nicos Savva](https://www.london.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty/profiles/savva-n) from the London Business School. Michael’s work has appeared in *Management Science*, and he acts as an ad-hoc reviewer for the journal *Production and Operations Management* and for the *Manufacturing and Service Operations Management Society*.

Michael currently teaches at the London Business School, and is a TA for the Dubai EMBA course ‘Data Analytics for Management’ and for the London MBA course ‘Data, Models and Decisions.’ He has co-lectured for the core MA and MPhil courses ‘Econometrics I’ and ‘Econometrics II’ at the Cambridge Judge Business School, where he has also served as a teaching associate for various programmes. During his undergraduate degree at the University of Warwick Michael assisted in teaching undergraduate courses in statistical computing and founded a seminar series to supplement mathematics lectures for statistics students, as well as teaching 5-14 year old school children with learning difficulties basic English and Mathematics.
 
Michael has worked with a number of organizations prior to and during his PhD studies, and is firmly committed to researching impactful problems inspired by and of importance to industry partners, as well as the academic community. During his MPhil studies Michael consulted with Tesco PLC on an inventory management system designed to improve the ordering of seasonal products, which formed the basis of his MPhil dissertation and increased his familiarity with core Operations Management principles. He also spent six months out of his PhD studies at the UK's National Statistics Agency where he worked on improving measures of health and education productivity using large, national data sets. Much of the inspiration for his current research has come from time spent working in hospitals, where he continues to meet regularly with senior management and clinical staff in order to discuss, advise on, and explore research opportunities relating to their ongoing strategic challenges.
