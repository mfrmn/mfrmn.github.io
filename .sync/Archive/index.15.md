**I am currently on the job market and will be available for interview during the 2016 INFORMS annual meeting in Nashville, TA.**

Welcome to my personal webpage, where I share information about my [research](/research/) interests and work, and where you can find out a little bit more [about me](/about/). My research is broadly in the area of Operations Management with a focus on empirical health care operations. More detailed information can be found at the following pages:

* [Curriculum Vitae](/CV/)
* [Job market paper](/scale-scope-hospital-productivity)
* [Research articles and interests](/research/)

If you would like to contact me then I can be reached at <a target="_blank" id="contact" href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01RgRLgvxEUrUhAUtFCSPNRA==&amp;c=0nIRqiLvmUU-5ifT56SvMSY2hB9qsGA9T0u6dIWkHPI=">mef3<span style="display:none">3829</span>5@cam.a<span style="display:none">k</span>c.uk</a>. I am very keen to collaborate with other researchers and to work with organizations - especially those working in the health care sector -  on projects of mutual interest.

Thanks for stopping by!
