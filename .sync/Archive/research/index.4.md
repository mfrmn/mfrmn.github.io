## Research overview

My research looks to draw causal inferences from observational data and quasi-experimental designs to identify those operational and behavioral factors that interfere with the delivery of high-value, high-quality coordinated health care services. Better value and higher quality are intrinsically linked to the objective of greater coordination of health service delivery, which is focused on providing patients with correct treatment of an appropriate intensity supplied by a suitable provider at the right time and place. Yet expansions in data and information sharing in the health sector have exposed huge disparity in health care costs and outcomes across providers, regions, and countries, signalling significant potential for improvement in how health services are coordinated and delivered. Leveraging this increasingly detailed micro- and macro-level data, my research employs sophisticated econometric techniques to explore how organizational conditions create discrepancies in health care service delivery. By understanding these processes and mechanisms better, my research aims to inform and transform the ways in which health professionals and policymakers deliver effective and efficient health care.
