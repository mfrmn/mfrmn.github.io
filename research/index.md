## Research overview [(pdf)](/research/FreemanMichael_ResearchSummary.pdf)

The health care industry – one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing industries, consuming nearly 10% of world and over 17% of US GDP – faces a tripartite challenge: costs continue to outgrow income, populations are ageing and becoming increasingly comorbid, while fewer people of working age are available to cover these expanding costs. To meet the fundamental challenge of improving clinical outcomes while controlling costs there is thus a pressing need to rethink and transform systems of health care delivery. At the same time, expansions in data and information sharing in the health sector have exposed huge disparity in costs and outcomes across providers, regions, and countries, signalling sig- nificant opportunities for shorter-term improvements in the coordination of health services. Leveraging this increasingly detailed process-, organization- and system-level data, my research employs sophisticated econometric techniques to explore how organizational conditions create discrepancies in health care delivery. By understanding these processes and mechanisms better, my research aims to inform and transform the ways in which health professionals and policymakers provide effective and efficient care.

A particular focus of my research is to understand in what ways hospitals -- described by Clayton Christensen as “some of the most managerially intractable institutions in the annals of capitalism” -- are affected both operationally and financially by the tremendous variability and uncertainty in patients’ service needs, and how to better manage the resultant complexity. To this end, I currently have three papers on this topic. The first, accepted at *Management Science*, shows that health care access varies depending on the workload of the service provider, with service complexity moderating this relationship. The second, in preparation for resubmission to *Management Science*, investigates the productivity implications of treating together patients with different levels of urgency and clinical need, finding benefits of greater specialization for planned care and pooling for emergent care. The third, in preparation for submission, examines the impact on routing decisions when diagnostic uncertainty is high and decision-makers are risk averse, and explores a mechanism that can be employed to reduce variability in service delivery.

In future research I intend to continue to study how health service delivery can be coordinated better so as to ensure that patients receive appropriate treatment from the right provider at the right time and place. With this stream of research I aspire to provide a prescriptive path as to how hospitals and other health providers can evolve their business models in order to meet the dual challenge of improving clinical outcomes while controlling costs. To achieve this it is important to me that I continue to build connections with local hospitals and other health providers, professionals and policymakers, as I have done during my Ph.D., in order to evolve new insights and perspectives, gain access to further data, and to disseminate the findings of my research. Forging relationships between academia and practice does I believe offer the best opportunity for innovative and relevant research with real and lasting impact.
