## Research overview

(See also full one-page non-technical [research summary](/research/FreemanMichael_ResearchSummary.pdf).)

My research is, broadly, empirical in approach and focuses on topics in health care operations management. I investigate in particular how hospitals – described by Clayton Christensen as “some of the most managerially intractable institutions in the annals of capitalism” – are affected both operationally and financially by the tremendous variability and uncertainty in patients’ service needs, and propose ways to better manage the resultant complexity. To this end, I currently have three papers on this topic (available below). The [first](/gatekeepers-at-work), accepted at *Management Science*, shows that health care access varies depending on the workload of the service provider, with service complexity moderating this relationship. The [second](/scale-scope-hospital-productivity), in preparation for resubmission to *Management Science*, investigates the productivity implications of treating together patients with different levels of urgency and clinical need, finding benefits of greater specialization for planned care and pooling for emergent care. The [third](/gatekeeping-under-uncertainty), in preparation for submission, examines the impact on routing decisions when diagnostic uncertainty is high and decision-makers are risk averse and explores a mechanism that can be employed to reduce variability in service delivery.
