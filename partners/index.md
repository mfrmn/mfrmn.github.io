I have helped a number of organizations in the health care sector to explore ways in which they can use the data that they collect to make better informed decisions. Examples of recent projects include:

* Examining data on emergency department attendances in the Cambridgeshire regional health economy to identify patterns associated with increases in demand.
* Building a predictive algorithm to identify which patients over the age of 65 are most likely to return to hospital and those who might benefit from a community intervention.
* Quantifying the extent to which an intervention targeted at reducing surgical site infections was successful, and the clinical and financial impact.

A number of the organizations who I have partnered with are listed below. If you would like to find out more about my previous projects, are an organization and would like advice on how to better leverage your data to inform strategic decision making, or would like to collaborate on a project of mutual (research related and practical) interest then please contact me.
