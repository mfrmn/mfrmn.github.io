I have helped a number of organizations in the health care sector to explore ways in which they can use the data that they collect in order to make better informed decisions. Examples of recent projects include:

* Building a predictive algorithm to identify those patients over the age of 65 who are likely to return to hospital an benefit fro intervention in the community.
* Examining data on emergency department attendances in the Cambridgeshire regional health economy to identify patterns associated with increases in demand.
* Determining whether an intervention aimed at reducing surgical site infections by a hospital was successful, and the clinical and financial implications.

A number of the organizations who I have partnered with are listed below. If you would like to find out more about my previous work, or if you would like advice on how to better leverage your data or would like to collaborate on a project of mutual interest then please feel free to contact me.
