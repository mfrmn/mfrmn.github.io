### Abstract

This paper studies the productivity implications of a fundamental reorganization of regional hospital systems, with general hospitals that focus on the provision of acute care for emergency patients complemented by high-volume, regionalized focused factories for elective patient services. Such a reorganization will require a significant change of patient volumes in hospitals and it is unclear whether potential economies of scale achieved by regionalizing elective care may be offset by productivity losses in the consequentially downsized general hospitals. Our data from 130 hospital trusts in England over a period of nine years suggests that while there are significant scale economies for elective and emergency services, the spillover effects are *negative*, i.e. reducing elective care volume in general hospitals will *improve* the productivity of emergency care in these hospitals. The data therefore suggests that separating elective care out of general hospitals will improve productivity for both elective and emergency patients. We also demonstrate that, while emergency patients benefit from pooling patients across different conditions, thus maintaining the notion of the general hospital for emergency services, there is no evidence of cross-condition productivity spillover for elective patients, which suggests that these patients are more efficiently treated in specialized focused factories.
