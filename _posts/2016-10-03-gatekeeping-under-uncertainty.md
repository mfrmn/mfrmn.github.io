### Abstract

We study admission and discharge errors made by physicians in a congested emergency department (ED) using a data set comprising more than 600,000 visits over a seven-year period. We find that when the ED becomes busier, physicians make increasingly more admission errors but also fewer discharge errors. This leads to a bullwhip-type effect: demand surges in the ED leads to relatively greater demand pressures in the hospital, as more patients are admitted unnecessarily. While this behavior can be rationalized at the level of the individual ED physician, who deploys a "safety first" principle and admits patients in case of doubt, the overall system effect is detrimental. In particular, unnecessary use of specialist hospital services leads to higher system costs, while a higher level of hospital occupancy is also known to have detrimental effects on patient outcomes e.g. longer lengths of stay and higher mortality rates. Having established the bullwhip phenomenon, we consider whether replacing the direct one-stage (ED physician to hospital) referral system with a two-stage process that also allows ED physicians to stream patients to an intermediate "semi-specialist" referral unit — in our context operationalized by a Clinical Decisions Unit — when diagnostic uncertainty is high can improve care coordination in gatekeeping systems. We find that such a unit can significantly reduce the negative demand-propagation effect, and the two-stage process to be significantly more effective than simply adding ED capacity. This beneficial effect is particularly pronounced for more error prone and risk averse gatekeepers, and when patients present with a higher degree of diagnostic uncertainty.
