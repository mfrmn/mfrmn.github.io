Thank you for visiting my homepage! This is my personal website where you can find out about my [research](/research/) and a little bit more [about me](/about/).
In addition, I intend to write and make available here a series of articles discussing the empirical challenges surrounding the use of patient-level data in academic (and other) research.

If you would like to contact me or comment on any of the articles posted here (or on my academic articles) then I would love to hear from you! I am very keen to collaborate on interesting projects (particularly with healthcare organisations), and am also available for ad-hoc consulting work.

Thanks again for stopping by!
