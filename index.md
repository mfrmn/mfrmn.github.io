**I am currently on the job market and will be available for interview during the 2016 INFORMS conference in Nashville, TA.**

Welcome to my personal webpage, where I share information about my [research](/research/) interests and work, and where you can find out a little bit more [about me](/about/). My research is broadly in the area of Operations Management with a focus on healthcare operations, service productivity and complexity, and worker behavior. For more detail on my research please use the sidebar to visit the relevant page, or see my biography for an overview.

If you would like to contact me then I can be reached at <a target="_blank" id="contact" href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01RgRLgvxEUrUhAUtFCSPNRA==&amp;c=0nIRqiLvmUU-5ifT56SvMSY2hB9qsGA9T0u6dIWkHPI=">mef3<span style="display:none">3829</span>5@cam.a<span style="display:none">k</span>c.uk</a>. I am very keen to collaborate with other researchers and to work with organizations - especially those working in the health care sector -  on projects of mutual interest.

Thanks for stopping by!
